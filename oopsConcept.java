//! What are Objects?
//* */ Objects are instances of classes. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

//! Class
//* A class is a blueprint for objects. It defines a data type that includes data members and member functions.

    String color;
    String type; 
    // These are properties of the class Pen ðŸ‘†

    }
    public void printColor(){
        System.out.println("Color: " + this.color); // this keyword is used to refer to the current object
    }
    // static methods can be called without creating an object of the class
    // we are not using static here because object is created in main method
}

        // 1. Default constructor
        // 2. Parameterized constructor
        // 3. Copy constructor
        //* Name of the constructor is same as the name of the class
        //* Constructor does not have a return type
        //* Constructor is called only once when an object is created
